# Dutch-Big5-SVM-vs-LSTM

In this project we critically evaluated the difference between a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) system in predicting Big Five personality traits in the Dutch language CLiPS Stylometry Corpus (CSI).


This repository contains two main notebooks:

* One containing stepwise instructions for building a binary SVM classifier from scratch (LTP_PROJECT_SVM)
* Another containing stepwise instructions for building an LSTM classifier from scratch (LTP_PROJECT_LSTM)
